**Version 0.1**



**What is this?**

A simple reddit saved post downloader written in Python.



**There are already several libraries that exist, why did you do this?**

Excellent question! I tried a few of the ones out there, they were either too complex to edit the code (code spread over multiple files) and I felt I could simplify the process. Also several were not updated to work with  Python3.



**Setup**

`pip install requirements.txt`

rename samle_config.py to config.py & add your info

python main.py

All files will be saved to the saved dir.
