**Curently Under Active Development, Some Stuff May Be Broken**



**Version 0.1**



**What is this?**

A simple reddit saved image downloader written in Python. Also a small local website to allow you to view the images you have downloaded.



**There are already several libraries that exist, why did you do this?**

Excellent question! I tried a few of the ones out there, they just didn't fit my needs. Some were either too simple or too basic. Once I wrote the basic scrapper to get the images I had lots of images over multiple folders, so I wrote a basic flask site to allow someone to search and navigate all the downloaded images.



**Setup**

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

rename samle_config.py to config.py & add your info



**Usage**

To get the images run `python main.py`

After downloader has completed run web.py to view

Navigate in your webbrowser to http://127.0.0.1 



**Bugs or Feature Requests**

Just open a new issue.
